Most traditional AI safety research has approached AI models as machines and centered on algorithm-focused 
attacks developed by pr experts. As \textit{large language models} (LLMs) become increasingly common and capable, this non-expert users can also pose risks during everyday interactions. This paper introduces a new perspective on L  
explore this overlooked interaction between everyday language and AI safety. Specifically, we study how to </same><del>e </del><add>implement </add><same>LLMs to </same><del>b </del><add>be </add><same>them. 
First, we propose a \textit{pr lexicality </same><add>score</add><same>resulting from </same><del>cads es. </del><add>a analysis of sentence-level structure. </add><same>Then we apply the \textit{lexi </same><del>to </del><add>t</add><same>automatic </same><del>e</del><same> </same><add></add><same>jailbreaking LLMs.
