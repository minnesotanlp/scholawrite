Most traditional AI safety research has approached AI models as machines and centered on algorithm-focused 
attacks developed by pr experts. As \textit{large language models} (LLMs) become increasingly common and capable, this non-expert users can also pose risks during everyday interactions. This paper introduces a new perspective on L
