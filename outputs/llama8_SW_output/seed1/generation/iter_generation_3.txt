Most traditional AI safety research has approach AI models as machines and centered on algorithm-focused 
attacks developed by promans. As \textit{large language models} (LLMs) become increasingly common and capable, this non-anonymous users can also pose risks during everyday interactions. This paper introduces a new perspective on L  
explorein this overlooked interaction between everyday language and AI safety. Specifically, we study how to implement LLMs to be them. 
First, we propose a \textit{pr lexicality scorereresulting from a analysis of sentence-level structure. Then we apply the \textit{lexi t computed lexical results to ail breaking LLMs. 
Results from this investigation are also extended into a novel metric for evaluating LLM-generated data in a. 
e explore various ncans against PAP, find a significant gap in existing empirical adise and explanations.
