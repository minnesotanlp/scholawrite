Most traditional AI safety research has approached AI models as machines and centered on algorithm-focused 
attacks developed by pr experts. As \textit{large language models} (LLMs) become increasingly common and capable, this non-expert users can also pose risks during everyday interactions. This paper introduces a new perspective on L  
explore this overlooked interaction between everyday language and AI safety. Specifically, we study how to implement LLMs to be them. 
First, we propose a \textit{pr lexicality scoreresulting from a analysis of sentence-level structure. Then we apply the \textit{lexi tautomatic  jailbreaking LLMs.
