Existing work has primarily implementation comparative construction, of o)stractive language data, supervisionbowever, construction models are only of practical value, if they can be trained with a limit amount of labeled data (cognitive) and a large amount of unlabeled data (sets)without labels data)We propose a semisupervised construction task in which the model is trained on only a smallest data (cognitive) with a proportion of tasks that have a highly constrained correctts)without labeled data)We propose a neural architecture for comparative construction involving essthat repaired words should not only be reconstructable from their words. We show that this architecture is able to ocompare labeled cognitive selevisv\end{abstract}
