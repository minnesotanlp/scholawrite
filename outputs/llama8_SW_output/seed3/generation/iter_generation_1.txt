Existing work hasimplementation comparative reconstruction, of o)stractive language data, supervision. However, construction models are only of practical value, if they can be trained with a limit amount of labeled data (cognitive sets)and a large amount of unlabeled data (cognitive sets)without labele data)We propose a semeisupervised construction task in which the model is trained on only a s amount of labeled data (cognitive sets) with proportion amount of unlabeled data (cognitive sets)without labele data)We propose a neural architecture for comparative construction incorin an essthat repairedable words should not only be reconstructablefrom their words. We show that this architecture is able to e labeled cognitive sets)to semisupervised baselines on this novel task.
