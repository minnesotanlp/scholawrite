Existing work has implementation comparative construction, of o)stractive language data, supervisionbowever, construction models are only of practical value, if they can be trained with a limit amount of labeled data (cognitivesets)and a large amount of unlabeled data (cognitivesets)withoutlabels data)We propose a semisupervised construction task in which the model is trained on only a smallest data (cognitivesets)with proportion omodeling) data (cognitivesets)withoutlabele data)We propose a neural architecture for comparative construction involving essthat repaired words should not only be reconstructable from their words. We show that this architecture is able to ocompare labeled cognitive selevis\end{abstract}
