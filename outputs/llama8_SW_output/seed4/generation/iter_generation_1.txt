We introduce F1, a family of large language models for evaluation of language quality. 
F1 is based on Llama 2, which on a new baseline composing 4.3M documents and 4.2B tokens. Addressing the scarcity of high-quality benchmarks for LQ, we further introduce F1-based evaluation datasets: euef1ce, euef1ce experiments. In our extensive evaluation, F1 outperforms all previous language models.We compare to b margin. In addition, it is e Both the F1 score and e examineuef1ce.
