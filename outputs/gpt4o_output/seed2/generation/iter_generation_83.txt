\begin{abstract}
Revision is an indispensable component of the human writing process, characterized by its strategic, adaptive, and, crucially, \textit{iterative} nature \cite{smith2018strategy}. Despite remarkable advancements in large language models for text revision tasks, their capabilities are generally confined to non-iterative, one-shot revisions \cite{jones2020one_shot}. Assessing and enhancing the potential of large language models to engage in continuous revisions and interact collaboratively with human writers is vital for developing robust writing assistants \cite{brown2021collaboration}. In this study, we introduce a human-in-the-loop iterative text revision framework named $\mathcal{R}$ead, $\mathcal{R}$evise, $\mathcal{R}$epeat (\textsc{$\mathcal{R}3$}). This system is crafted to achieve high-quality text revisions with minimal human input by processing model-generated revisions and user feedback, revising documents, and ensuring sustained human-machine interactions. Within \textsc{$\mathcal{R}3$}, the text revision model provides text editing suggestions for human authors, who may choose to accept or reject the proposed modifications \cite{lee2019human_loop}. Accepted changes are incorporated back into the model for further iterations of document refinement. Authors can iteratively update documents by interacting with the system, accepting or rejecting its proposed edits, until the text revision model either ceases further revisions or reaches a predefined revision limit. Empirical analyses demonstrate that \textsc{$\mathcal{R}3$} can achieve revisions with acceptance rates akin to those of human authors during initial revision stages, while human-machine collaboration can yield superior quality revisions requiring fewer iterations and modifications, as detailed in Table \ref{tab:acceptance-rate} \cite{zhang2022iterative_revisions}.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The iterative process of revision in writing is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:revision-cycle}. Here, the cycle of reading, revising, and repeating underscores the non-linear and cyclical trajectory of refinement \cite{johnson2022revision_cycles}. The essence of this approach lies in its continuous adaptability, enabling the crafting of text that not only aligns with user intent but also adheres to evolving writing standards. This iterative process is essential to the operation of our proposed \textsc{$\mathcal{R}3$} system, as described in Section \ref{sec:system}.

\section{System Framework} \label{sec:system}

\subsection{Architecture and Workflow}
The proposed \textsc{$\mathcal{R}3$} framework utilizes a feedback loop that enhances text quality through user interactions. To exemplify the feedback efficiency, consider the structural flowchart in Figure \ref{fig:system-architecture}, which outlines the system framework from user input to iteration completion \cite{clark2022collaboration_effectiveness}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Metrics for Evaluation}
The effectiveness of \textsc{$\mathcal{R}3$} can be quantified by measuring the acceptance rate of suggested revisions \cite{garcia2021revision_metrics}. As shown in Table \ref{tab:acceptance-rate}, the acceptance rates provide a comprehensive comparison between different revision stages. Additionally, the structural feedback efficiency of the system is expressed in Equation \ref{eq:efficiency}, which measures the rate of human-machine improvement per iteration. This quantification demonstrates an upward trajectory toward more cohesive and superior texts, aligning with the findings discussed in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{Xccc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Revision Stage} & \textbf{Human Authors} & \textbf{Machine Suggestions} & \textbf{\textsc{$\mathcal{R}3$} Collaboration} \\
    \midrule
    Initial Revision & 75\% & 40\% & 70\% \\
    Subsequent Revisions & 80\% & 60\% & 85\% \\
    Final Revisions & 90\% & 70\% & 95\% \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabularx} 
  \caption{Comparison of acceptance rates across different revision stages, as referenced in Section \ref{sec:system} \cite{clark2022collaboration_effectiveness}.}
  \label{tab:acceptance-rate}
\end{table}

\begin{equation}
  \text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Number of Accepted Revisions}}{\text{Total Iterations}}
  \label{eq:efficiency}
\end{equation}

\begin{footnotesize}
\textbf{Footnote:} The acceptance rates shown in Table \ref{tab:acceptance-rate} highlight the increased efficiency when human-machine collaboration is leveraged, emphasizing the value of iterative feedback \cite{johnson2022revision_cycles}.
\end{footnotesize}

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusion}
The integration of human feedback effectively enhances the model's ability to propose relevant revisions, thereby reducing the number of iterations necessary for high-quality document refinement. The results are quantitatively supported by the acceptance rates shown in Table \ref{tab:acceptance-rate}, which indicate a substantial boost in efficiency when human-machine collaboration is employed \cite{clark2022collaboration_effectiveness}. The improved efficiency metric, as defined in Equation \ref{eq:efficiency}, further confirms the accelerated achievement of satisfactory text quality. These insights imply that human-in-the-loop systems not only augment writer productivity but also facilitate the attainment of text alignment with complex stylistic and contextual nuances.
