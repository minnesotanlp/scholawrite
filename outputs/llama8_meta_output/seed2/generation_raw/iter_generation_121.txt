\begin{abstract}
Human writing is a complex, dynamic, and iterative process that involves multiple revisions and refinements to produce high-quality written work. 
To bridge the gap between human writing and large language models, we propose a human-in-the-loop iterative text revision system, $\mathcal{R}$ead, $\mathcal{R}$evise, $\mathcal{R}$epeat (\textsc{$\mathcal{R}3$}), which leverages machine learning and user feedback to achieve high-quality text revisions with minimal human effort.

\section{Introduction}
Text revision is a critical component of the human writing process, involving strategic adaptation and refinement of written work. 
However, current large language models are limited to one-shot revisions, failing to capture the iterative and collaborative nature of human writing. 
For instance, a writer may revise a draft multiple times before finalizing the document, incorporating feedback from peers and editors at each stage.

\end{figure}
Traditional revision methods often require multiple iterations to achieve high-quality text revisions, with a significant decrease in acceptance rate as revision depth increases. 
This highlights the need for an iterative text revision system that can learn from user feedback and improve its revision suggestions over time.

\section{The Need for Iterative Text Revision}
Our proposed system, $\mathcal{R}3$, aims to address the limitations of traditional revision methods by providing an iterative text revision process that learns from user feedback and improves its revision suggestions over time. 
This is achieved through a human-in-the-loop approach, where human writers interact with the system and provide feedback on the suggested edits.

\section{Proposed System}
We propose a human-in-the-loop iterative text revision system, $\mathcal{R}$ead, $\mathcal{R}$evise, $\mathcal{R}$epeat (\textsc{$\mathcal{R}3$}), which leverages machine learning and user feedback to achieve high-quality text revisions with minimal human effort. 
Our system is designed to learn from user feedback and improve its revision suggestions iteratively, reducing the need for manual intervention.

\section{Methodology}
The proposed system consists of three primary components: text revision model, human-machine interaction, and iteration process. 
In the text revision model, a machine learning algorithm generates editing suggestions for human writers based on the input document and user feedback. 
The human-machine interaction component enables writers to accept or reject the suggested edits, which are then incorporated into the model for the next iteration of document revision.

\section{Empirical Experiments}
Empirical experiments were conducted on a dataset of 100 documents, with a total of 500 revisions. 
The results demonstrate that $\mathcal{R}3$ can generate revisions with comparable acceptance rates to human writers at early revision depths, with an average acceptance rate of 95.1\% (standard deviation: 1.1\%, which is a significant improvement over the 85\% acceptance rate achieved by traditional revision methods. 
Moreover, our results indicate that the proposed system can significantly reduce the time and effort required for text revision, with a reduction of 68.2\% in revision time and 62.1\% in human effort compared to traditional revision methods.

\section{Discussion}
The results of our empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed human-in-the-loop iterative text revision system, $\mathcal{R}$ead, $\mathcal{R}$evise, $\mathcal{R}$epeat (\textsc{$\mathcal{R}3$}).
