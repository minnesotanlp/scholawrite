\begin{abstract}
Human writing is an iterative process that involves revision, with writers strategically adapting and refining their work. 
Despite the success of large language models in text revision tasks, their one-shot revisions are limited, failing to capture the collaborative and continuous nature of human writing. 
To bridge this gap, we propose a human-in-the-loop iterative text revision system, $\mathcal{R}$ead, $\mathcal{R}$evise, $\mathcal{R}$epeat (\textsc{$\mathcal{R}3$}), which leverages machine learning and user feedback to achieve high-quality text revisions with minimal human effort.
Our system is designed to learn from user feedback and improve its revision suggestions iteratively, reducing the need for manual intervention. 
In the proposed system, a text revision model generates editing suggestions for human writers, who can accept or reject the suggested edits. 
The accepted edits are then incorporated into the model for the next iteration of document revision. 
Writers can iteratively revise documents by interacting with the system and accepting or rejecting its suggested edits until the text revision model stops making further revisions or reaches a predefined maximum number of revisions.

Empirical experiments demonstrate that $\mathcal{R}3$ can generate revisions with comparable acceptance rates to human writers at early revision depths, and human-machine interaction can yield higher quality revisions with fewer iterations and edits. 
Moreover, our results indicate that the proposed system can significantly reduce the time and effort required for text revision, making it a valuable tool for writers, editors, and content creators.

\section{Introduction}
Text revision is a critical component of the human writing process, involving strategic adaptation and refinement of written work. 
However, current large language models are limited to one-shot revisions, failing to capture the collaborative and continuous nature of human writing. 
For instance, a writer may revise a draft multiple times before finalizing the document, incorporating feedback from peers and editors at each stage.

\section{Proposed System}
We propose a human-in-the-loop iterative text revision system, $\mathcal{R}$ead, $\mathcal{R}$evise, $\mathcal{R}$epeat (\textsc{$\mathcal{R}3$}), which aims to achieve high-quality text revisions with minimal human effort. 
Our system is designed to learn from user feedback and improve its revision suggestions iteratively, reducing the need for manual intervention.

\section{Methodology}
The proposed system consists of three primary components: text revision model, human-machine interaction, and iteration process. 
In the text revision model, a machine learning algorithm generates editing suggestions for human writers based on the input document and user feedback. 
The human-machine interaction component enables writers to accept or reject the suggested edits, which are then incorporated into the model for the next iteration of document revision.

\section{Empirical Experiments}
Empirical experiments demonstrate that $\mathcal{R}3$ can generate revisions with comparable acceptance rates to human writers at early revision depths, and human-machine interaction can yield higher quality revisions with fewer iterations and edits. 
Moreover, our results indicate that the proposed system can significantly reduce the time and effort required for text revision.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, our proposed human-in-the-loop iterative text revision system, $\mathcal{R}$ead, $\mathcal{R}$evise, $\mathcal{R}$epeat (\textsc{$\mathcal{R}3$}), can achieve high-quality text revisions with minimal human effort. 
Our system has the potential to revolutionize the writing process, making it a valuable tool for writers, editors, and content creators.
