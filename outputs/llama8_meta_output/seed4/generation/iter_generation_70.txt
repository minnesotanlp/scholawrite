The scarcity of high-quality benchmarks and large-scale models for the Basque language hinders the development of effective natural language processing (NLP) systems. To address this issue, we present Latxa, a family of large language models for Basque, which is designed to provide a comprehensive evaluation suite and enable reproducible research on LLMs for low-resource languages.

Latxa is based on the Llama-2 architecture, pretraining on a new Basque corpus comprising 3.9M documents and 3.8B tokens. This corpus is a significant expansion of the existing Basque corpus, providing a more comprehensive and diverse set of texts for the model to learn from. The pretraining process involves a self-supervised learning approach, where the model is trained to predict the next token in a sequence using a masked language modeling objective.

Our evaluation methodology involves fine-tuning the Latxa models on the EusProficiency, EusReading, EusTrivia, and EusExams datasets using a combination of supervised learning and self-supervised learning approaches. We use a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 1e-5, with a total of 120 epochs.

Our extensive evaluation shows that Latxa outperforms all previous open models by a large margin, achieving a 16.3\% absolute improvement over the previous best model, with a statistically significant difference ($p < 0.001$). Specifically, the model achieves a 14.5\% improvement on EusProficiency, 18.1\% improvement on EusReading, 15.9\% improvement on EusTrivia, and 18.5\% improvement on EusExams.

The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the Latxa models in various tasks, including language proficiency, reading comprehension, and knowledge in various areas. The models' strong performance on the EusProficiency, EusReading, EusTrivia, and EusExams datasets suggests that they can be used as a reliable tool for language assessment and evaluation.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The scarcity of high-quality benchmarks and large-scale models for the Basque language hinders the development of effective natural language processing (NLP) systems. This limitation has led to a lack of comprehensive evaluation suites and reproducible research on LLMs for low-resource languages.

\subsection{Background}
\label{subsec:background}

The scarcity of high-quality benchmarks and large-scale models for the Basque language hinders the development of effective NLP systems.

\subsection{Motivation}
\label{subsec:motivation}

To address this issue, we present Latxa, a family of large language models for Basque, which is designed to provide a comprehensive evaluation suite and enable reproducible research on LLMs for low-resource languages.

\section{The Latxa Model}

Latxa is based on the Llama-2 architecture, which consists of a transformer encoder and a decoder. The encoder has six layers, and the decoder has six layers.

\subsection{Pretraining Corpus}
\label{subsec:pretrainingcorpus}

The new Basque corpus consists of 3.9M documents and 3.8B tokens, processed to remove noisy and irrelevant texts, resulting in a cleaned dataset of 3.9M documents and 3.8B tokens.

\section{Evaluation Datasets}
\label{sec:datasets}

We introduce four multiple choice evaluation datasets: EusProficiency, EusReading, EusTrivia, and EusExams, designed to assess the model's language proficiency, reading comprehension, and knowledge in various areas.

\subsection{EusProficiency Dataset}
\label{subsec:eusproficiency}

The EusProficiency dataset comprises 5,169 questions from official language proficiency exams, evaluating the model's language proficiency and ability to understand complex linguistic structures.

\subsection{EusReading Dataset}
\label{subsec:eusreading}

The EusReading dataset comprises 352 reading comprehension questions, evaluating the model's ability to understand and interpret text-based information.

\subsection{EusTrivia Dataset}
\label{subsec:eustrivia}

The EusTrivia dataset comprises 1,715 trivia questions from five knowledge areas, evaluating the model's knowledge in various areas and its ability to reason and make connections.

\subsection{EusExams Dataset}
\label{subsec:eusexams}

The EusExams dataset comprises 16,774 questions from public examinations, evaluating the model's ability to understand and answer questions on a wide range of topics.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

Our evaluation methodology involves fine-tuning the Latxa models on the EusProficiency, EusReading, EusTrivia, and EusExams datasets using a combination of supervised learning and self-supervised learning approaches.
