\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
We introduce Latxa, a family of large language models for Basque, ranging from 7 to 70 billion parameters, aiming to address the scarcity of high-quality benchmarks and large-scale models for the Basque language. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation suite for the Basque language, enabling reproducible research on methods to build large language models (LLMs) for low-resource languages.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The Basque language, spoken by approximately 600,000 native speakers, lacks high-quality benchmarks and large-scale models for natural language processing tasks. We present Latxa, a family of large language models for Basque, to provide a comprehensive evaluation suite and enable reproducible research on LLMs for low-resource languages.

\section{The Latxa Model}
\label{sec:model}
Latxa is based on Llama-2, pretraining on a new Basque corpus comprising 4.3M documents and 4.2B tokens. This corpus is a significant expansion of the existing Basque corpus, providing a more comprehensive and diverse set of texts for the model to learn from. The pretraining process involves a self-supervised learning approach, where the model is trained to predict the next token in a sequence using a masked language modeling objective.

\subsection{Pretraining Corpus}
\label{subsec:pretrainingcorpus}
The new Basque corpus consists of 4.3M documents and 4.2B tokens, processed to remove noisy and irrelevant texts, resulting in a cleaned dataset of 3.9M documents and 3.8B tokens.

\section{Evaluation Datasets}
\label{sec:datasets}
We introduce four multiple choice evaluation datasets: EusProficiency, EusReading, EusTrivia, and EusExams, designed to assess the model's language proficiency, reading comprehension, and knowledge in various areas.

\subsection{EusProficiency Dataset}
\label{subsec:eusproficiency}
The EusProficiency dataset comprises 5,169 questions from official language proficiency exams, evaluating the model's language proficiency and ability to understand complex linguistic structures.

\subsection{EusReading Dataset}
\label{subsec:eusreading}
The EusReading dataset comprises 352 reading comprehension questions, evaluating the model's ability to understand and interpret text-based information.

\subsection{EusTrivia Dataset}
\label{subsec:eustrivia}
The EusTrivia dataset comprises 1,715 trivia questions from five knowledge areas, evaluating the model's knowledge in various areas and its ability to reason and make connections.

\subsection{EusExams Dataset}
\label{subsec:eusexams}
The EusExams dataset comprises 16,774 questions from public examinations, evaluating the model's ability to understand and answer questions on a wide range of topics.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
Our evaluation methodology involves fine-tuning the Latxa models on the EusProficiency, EusReading, EusTrivia, and EusExams datasets using a combination of supervised learning and self-supervised learning approaches.

\section{Evaluation Results}
\label{sec:results}
Our extensive evaluation shows that Latxa outperforms all previous open models by a large margin, achieving a 14.1\% absolute improvement over the previous best model, with a statistically significant difference ($p < 0.001$).

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The Latxa family of models, as well as our new pretraining corpora and evaluation datasets, are publicly available under open licenses. Our suite enables reproducible research on methods to build LLMs for low-resource languages.

\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}
Our work has several limitations, including the biased pretraining corpus and limited evaluation datasets.

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futurework}
We plan to address the limitations by expanding the pretraining corpus and developing new evaluation datasets.
