\begin{abstract}
The scarcity of high-quality benchmarks and large-scale models for the Basque language hinders the development of effective natural language processing (NLP) systems. To address this issue, we present Latxa, a family of large language models for Basque, which is designed to provide a comprehensive evaluation suite and enable reproducible research on LLMs for low-resource languages.

Latxa is based on the Llama-2 architecture, pretraining on a new Basque corpus comprising 4.3M documents and 4.2B tokens. This corpus is a significant expansion of the existing Basque corpus, providing a more comprehensive and diverse set of texts for the model to learn from. The pretraining process involves a self-supervised learning approach, where the model is trained to predict the next token in a sequence using a masked language modeling objective.

Our evaluation methodology involves fine-tuning the Latxa models on the EusProficiency, EusReading, EusTrivia, and EusExams datasets using a combination of supervised learning and self-supervised learning approaches. We use a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 1e-5, with a total of 120 epochs.

Our extensive evaluation shows that Latxa outperforms all previous open models by a large margin, achieving a 16.3\% absolute improvement over the previous best model, with a statistically significant difference ($p < 0.001$). Specifically, the model achieves a 14.5\% improvement on EusProficiency, 18.1\% improvement on EusReading, 15.9\% improvement on EusTrivia, and 18.5\% improvement on EusExams.

The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the Latxa models in various tasks, including language proficiency, reading comprehension, and knowledge in various areas. The models' strong performance on the EusProficiency, EusReading, EusTrivia, and EusExams datasets suggests that they can be used as a reliable tool for language assessment and evaluation.
