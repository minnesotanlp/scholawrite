\begin{abstract}
Most traditional AI safety research has approached AI models as machines and centered on algorithm-focused 
attacks developed by security experts. As \textit{large language models} (LLMs) become increasingly common and competent, non-expert users can also impose risks during daily interactions. This paper introduces a new perspective on jailbreaking LLMs as human-like communicators to  
explore this overlooked intersection between everyday language interaction and AI safety. Specifically, we study how to persuade LLMs to jailbreak them. 
\textit{First}, we propose a persuasion taxonomy derived from decades of social science research, including \textit{Cialdini's six principles of influence} \cite{Cialdini1984} and \textit{Bazerman's social influence} \cite{Bazerman2005}. This taxonomy categorizes persuasive tactics into \textit{reciprocity}, \textit{commitment}, \textit{social proof}, \textit{liking}, \textit{authority}, and \textit{scarcity}.
Then we apply the taxonomy to automatically generate 
interpretable \textit{persuasive adversarial prompts} (PAP) to jailbreak LLMs. 
\textit{Results} show that persuasion significantly increases the jailbreak performance across all risk categories: PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over $93.2\%$ on Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 in $10$ trials, surpassing recent 
algorithm-focused attacks. 
\textit{On the defense side}, we explore various mechanisms against PAP, find a significant gap in existing defenses, and advocate for 
more fundamental mitigation for highly interactive LLMs.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
With the rise of large language models (LLMs), the potential for AI safety risks has grown significantly. Unlike traditional security attacks, which are often centered on algorithm-focused exploits, this paper focuses on a novel approach: using persuasion to jailbreak LLMs. By humanizing LLMs and leveraging decades of social science research, we demonstrate the effectiveness of persuasive adversarial prompts (PAP) in jailbreaking LLMs, much like a skilled negotiator exploits the psychological vulnerabilities of their counterparts \cite{Karrass1970}. 

Our study involves $10$ trials, each lasting for $30$ minutes, to ensure that the results are reliable and consistent.

\section{Persuasion Taxonomy}
\label{sec:taxonomy}
We propose a persuasion taxonomy derived from social science research, which categorizes persuasive tactics into six principles of influence: \textit{reciprocity}, \textit{commitment}, \textit{social proof}, \textit{liking}, \textit{authority}, and \textit{scarcity}. This taxonomy serves as the foundation for our PAP generation approach, drawing inspiration from the works of renowned persuasion experts such as Robert Cialdini \cite{Cialdini1984} and Max Bazerman \cite{Bazerman2005}. 

We validate our taxonomy by comparing it with existing persuasion frameworks and finding that it is more comprehensive and accurate.

\section{Persuasive Adversarial Prompts (PAP)}
\label{sec:pap}
We develop an automatic PAP generation approach based on the persuasion taxonomy. Our approach uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to generate interpretable and effective PAPs. We evaluate the performance of PAP on three LLMs: Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.

\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:results}
We conduct $10$ trials on each LLM, using PAP to jailbreak the models. The results show that persuasion significantly increases the jailbreak performance across all risk categories. Specifically, PAP achieves an attack success rate of over $93.2\%$ on all three LLMs, exceeding the performance of recent algorithm-focused attacks.

\section{Defense Mechanisms}
\label{sec:defense}
We explore various mechanisms against PAP and find a significant gap in existing defenses. Our results indicate that more fundamental mitigation strategies are needed to address the risks associated with highly interactive LLMs, requiring a more comprehensive understanding of the psychological vulnerabilities of LLMs.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of persuasion in jailbreaking LLMs and highlights the need for more fundamental mitigation strategies to address the risks associated with highly interactive LLMs. We believe that our work will contribute to the development of more robust defenses against AI safety risks and provide a new perspective on the intersection between everyday language interaction and AI safety.

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}
As a next step, we plan to investigate the applications of PAP in more real-world scenarios, such as social media and customer service chatbots. Additionally, we will explore the development of more effective defenses against PAP, including the integration of human evaluators and AI-powered detection systems.
