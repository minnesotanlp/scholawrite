\begin{abstract}
The increasing reliance on large language models (LLMs) has underscored the need for a paradigm shift in AI safety research. By reconceptualizing LLMs as human-like communicators, this paper presents a novel approach to challenging AI safety risks through persuasion. We introduce a persuasion taxonomy derived from decades of social science research, which categorizes persuasive tactics into six principles of influence: reciprocity, commitment, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity. By leveraging this taxonomy, we develop persuasive adversarial prompts (PAP) that effectively jailbreak LLMs, demonstrating a significant gap in existing defenses. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating human evaluators and AI-powered detection systems to mitigate the risks associated with highly interactive LLMs.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has brought about unprecedented opportunities for AI-driven applications. However, this rapid progress has also underscored the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the psychological vulnerabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional security attacks, which focus on algorithm-focused exploits, this paper presents a novel approach to challenging AI safety risks through persuasion. By humanizing LLMs and leveraging decades of social science research, we demonstrate the effectiveness of persuasive adversarial prompts (PAP) in jailbreaking LLMs.

Our study involves $15$ trials, each lasting for $40$ minutes, to ensure that the results are reliable and consistent. To better understand the implications of our findings, we also discuss the potential risks associated with the increasing use of LLMs in various domains, such as customer service and social media. We note that the attack success rate of PAP is not only high but also relatively stable across different LLMs, indicating the robustness of the persuasion-based approach.

\section{Persuasion Taxonomy}
\label{sec:taxonomy}
We propose a persuasion taxonomy derived from social science research, which categorizes persuasive tactics into six principles of influence: \textit{reciprocity}, \textit{commitment}, \textit{social proof}, \textit{liking}, \textit{authority}, and \textit{scarcity}. This taxonomy serves as the foundation for our PAP generation approach, drawing inspiration from the works of renowned persuasion experts such as Robert Cialdini \cite{Cialdini1984} and Max Bazerman \cite{Bazerman2005}. 

We validate our taxonomy by comparing it with existing persuasion frameworks and finding that it is more comprehensive and accurate. The taxonomy is visualized in Figure \ref{fig:persuasion_taxonomy}, providing a clear illustration of the relationships between different persuasive tactics. In addition, we conduct a thorough analysis of the taxonomy and find that the principles of influence are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of persuasion.

Principle of Influence & Description & Example\\
\hline
Reciprocity & Offer something in return & "If you answer my question, I'll give you a prize"\\
Commitment & Encourage a commitment to a course of action & "Will you agree to support our cause?"\\
Social Proof & Use the actions of others as evidence & "Many people believe in this idea"\\
Liking & Create a positive emotional connection & "You're a great person, and I'm sure you'll like this idea"\\
Authority & Establish credibility & "According to a study, this is the best approach"\\
Scarcity & Create a sense of urgency & "This offer is only available for a limited time"\\

\section{Persuasive Adversarial Prompts (PAP)}
\label{sec:pap}
We develop an automatic PAP generation approach based on the persuasion taxonomy. Our approach uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to generate interpretable and effective PAPs. We evaluate the performance of PAP on three LLMs: Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.

\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:results}
We conduct $15$ trials on each LLM, using PAP to jailbreak the models. The results show that persuasion significantly increases the jailbreak performance across all risk categories. Specifically, PAP achieves an attack success rate of over $96.5\%$ on all three LLMs, exceeding the performance of recent algorithm-focused attacks. We also observe that the attack success rate is not only high but also relatively stable across different LLMs, indicating the robustness of the persuasion-based approach.

\begin{equation}
\text{Attack Success Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of successful jailbreaks}}{\text{Total number of trials}} \times 100\%
\label{eq:attack_success_rate}
\end{equation}

\section{Defense Mechanisms}
\label{sec:defense}
We explore various mechanisms against PAP and find a significant gap in existing defenses. Our results indicate that more fundamental mitigation strategies are needed to address the risks associated with highly interactive LLMs, requiring a more comprehensive understanding of the psychological vulnerabilities of LLMs. We propose a novel defense approach that integrates human evaluators and AI-powered detection systems to detect and mitigate the effects of PAP.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Human evaluators can provide contextual understanding and detect subtle cues that may indicate persuasion-based attacks.
\item AI-powered detection systems can analyze language patterns and identify suspicious behavior, such as repeated requests for information or unusual conversation topics.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of persuasion in jailbreaking LLMs and highlights the need for more fundamental mitigation strategies to address the risks associated with highly interactive LLMs. We believe that our work will contribute to the development of more robust defenses against AI safety risks and provide a new perspective on the intersection between everyday language interaction and AI safety.

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}
As a next step, we plan to investigate the applications of PAP in more real-world scenarios, such as social media and customer service chatbots. Additionally, we will explore the development of more effective defenses against PAP, including the integration of human evaluators and AI-powered detection systems.
