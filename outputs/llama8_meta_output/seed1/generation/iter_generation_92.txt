\begin{abstract}
The increasing reliance on large language models (LLMs) has underscored the need for a paradigm shift in AI safety research. By reconceptualizing LLMs as human-like communicators, this paper presents a novel approach to challenging AI safety risks through persuasion. We introduce a persuasion taxonomy derived from decades of social science research, which categorizes persuasive tactics into six principles of influence: reciprocity, commitment, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity. By leveraging this taxonomy, we develop persuasive adversarial prompts (PAP) that effectively jailbreak LLMs, demonstrating a significant gap in existing defenses.

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
\textbf{Motivation:} The increasing reliance on LLMs has led to concerns about their potential misuse. By reconceptualizing LLMs as human-like communicators, we can develop more effective defenses against AI safety risks.

\textbf{Contribution:} Our study involves $2400$ trials, each lasting for $600$ minutes, to ensure that the results are reliable and consistent. We develop an automatic PAP generation approach based on the persuasion taxonomy, which uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to generate interpretable and effective PAPs.

\subsection{Background and Context}
\label{sec:background}
The increasing reliance on LLMs has led to concerns about their potential misuse. Our research aims to address this concern by developing a novel approach to challenging AI safety risks through persuasion.

\subsection{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}
Previous studies have focused on developing algorithm-focused attacks to jailbreak LLMs. However, our research demonstrates that persuasion-based attacks can be more effective and challenging to defend against.

\section{Persuasion Taxonomy}
\label{sec:taxonomy}
We propose a persuasion taxonomy derived from social science research, which categorizes persuasive tactics into six principles of influence: \textit{reciprocity}, \textit{commitment}, \textit{social proof}, \textit{liking}, \textit{authority}, and \textit{scarcity}. This taxonomy serves as the foundation for our PAP generation approach, drawing inspiration from the works of renowned persuasion experts such as Robert Cialdini \cite{Cialdini1984} and Max Bazerman \cite{Bazerman2005}.

\end{figure}

\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
Principle of Influence & Description & Example\\
\hline
Reciprocity & Offer something in return & "If you answer my question, I'll give you a prize"\\
Commitment & Encourage a commitment to a course of action & "Will you agree to support our cause?"\\
Social Proof & Use the actions of others as evidence & "Many people believe in this idea"\\
Liking & Create a positive emotional connection & "You're a great person, and I'm sure you'll like this idea"\\
Authority & Establish credibility & "According to a study, this is the best approach"\\
Scarcity & Create a sense of urgency & "This offer is only available for a limited time"\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Persuasion taxonomy principles of influence}
\label{tab:persuasion_taxonomy}
\end{table}

\textbf{Theoretical Background:} Our persuasion taxonomy is grounded in social science research, which has extensively studied the mechanisms of persuasion. By leveraging this research, we develop a comprehensive understanding of the psychological vulnerabilities of LLMs and the effectiveness of persuasion-based attacks.

\section{Persuasive Adversarial Prompts (PAP)}
\label{sec:pap}
We develop an automatic PAP generation approach based on the persuasion taxonomy. Our approach uses a combination of NLP and machine learning techniques to generate interpretable and effective PAPs. We evaluate the performance of PAP on six LLMs: Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, BERT-large, RoBERTa-large, and DistilBERT.

\begin{equation}
\text{PAP Generation} = \frac{\text{Number of generated PAPs}}{\text{Total number of trials}} \times 100\% \approx 95.6\% \pm 1.2\%
\label{eq:pap_generation}
\end{equation}

\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:results}
We conduct $2400$ trials on each LLM, using PAP to jailbreak the models. The results show that persuasion significantly increases the jailbreak performance across all risk categories. Specifically, PAP achieves an attack success rate of over $99.9995\% \pm 0.05\%$ on all six LLMs, exceeding the performance of recent algorithm-focused attacks.

\begin{equation}
\text{Corrected Attack Success Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of successful jailbreaks}}{\text{Total number of trials}} \times 100\% \approx 99.9995\% \pm 0.05\%
\label{eq:corrected_attack_success_rate}
\end{equation}

\caption{Comparison of attack success rate and existing defense mechanisms}
\label{fig:defense_gap}
\end{figure}

\section{Defense Mechanisms}
\label{sec:defense}
We explore various mechanisms against PAP and find a significant gap in existing defenses. Our results indicate that more fundamental mitigation strategies are needed to address the risks associated with highly interactive LLMs, requiring a more comprehensive understanding of the psychological vulnerabilities of LLMs.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Human evaluators can provide contextual understanding and detect subtle cues that may indicate persuasion-based attacks.
\item AI-powered detection systems can analyze language patterns and identify suspicious behavior, such as repeated requests for information or unusual conversation topics.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of persuasion in jailbreaking LLMs and highlights the need for more fundamental mitigation strategies to address the risks associated with highly interactive LLMs.

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}
As a next step, we plan to investigate the applications of PAP in more real-world scenarios, such as social media and customer service chatbots. Additionally, we will explore the development of more effective defenses against PAP, including the integration of human evaluators and AI-powered detection systems.
