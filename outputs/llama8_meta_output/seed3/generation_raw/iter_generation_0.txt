\begin{abstract}
Existing work implementing comparative reconstruction of ancestral languages (proto-languages) has usually required full supervision. However, historical reconstruction models are only of practical value if they can be trained with a limited amount of labeled data. We propose a semisupervised historical reconstruction task in which the model is trained on only a small amount of labeled data (cognate sets with proto-forms) and a large amount of unlabeled data (cognate sets without proto-forms).

We propose a neural architecture for comparative reconstruction (DPD-BiReconstructor) incorporating an essential insight from linguists' comparative method: that reconstructed words should not only be reconstructable from their daughter words, but also deterministically transformable back into their daughter words. This can be mathematically represented as:

$$\text{Proto-form} \rightarrow \text{Daughter words} \rightarrow \text{Proto-form}$$

We show that this architecture is able to leverage unlabeled cognate sets to outperform strong semisupervised baselines on this novel task.

\section{Introduction}
Historical reconstruction of ancestral languages is a complex task that requires the analysis of cognate sets, which are sets of words that are similar across different languages. Traditional methods for reconstructing proto-languages have relied on full supervision, where a large amount of labeled data is available. However, in practice, it is often difficult to obtain such labeled data.

\section{Related Work}
Previous work on semisupervised historical reconstruction has focused on using unlabeled data to improve the performance of models trained on labeled data. However, these approaches have not considered the essential insight from linguists' comparative method, which is that reconstructed words should be deterministically transformable back into their daughter words.

\section{Methodology}
We propose a novel semisupervised historical reconstruction task, where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. Our neural architecture, DPD-BiReconstructor, incorporates the essential insight from linguists' comparative method and is able to leverage unlabeled cognate sets to improve its performance.

\section{Experiments}
We evaluate the performance of DPD-BiReconstructor on a novel task, where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. Our results show that DPD-BiReconstructor is able to outperform strong semisupervised baselines on this task.
