\begin{abstract}
We introduce a novel semisupervised historical reconstruction task that leverages the fundamental principle from linguists' comparative method: reconstructed words should be deterministically transformable back into their daughter words. Our approach, DPD-BiReconstructor, surpasses strong semisupervised baselines on this novel task by an average margin of 18.2\% \cite{ref:previous_work}. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting a novel task, where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.

This task is visualized in Figure \ref{fig:task}, where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data (approximately 25\% of the total data) and a large amount of unlabeled data.

Our approach is motivated by the following mathematical representation of the deterministic relationship between proto-forms and daughter words:

$$\text{Proto-form} \xrightarrow{\text{Deterministic Algorithm}} \text{Daughter words} \xrightarrow{\text{Deterministic Algorithm}} \text{Proto-form} \xrightarrow{\text{Deterministic Algorithm}} \text{Daughter words}$$

Here, DA denotes the deterministic algorithm used to transform proto-forms into daughter words and vice versa.

This deterministic relationship is crucial for the success of our approach, as it enables the model to leverage unlabeled cognate sets to enhance its performance on this novel task.

We show that our approach is able to outperform strong semisupervised baselines on this novel task by an average margin of 18.2\%.

\section{Introduction}
Historical reconstruction of ancestral languages is a complex task that necessitates the analysis of cognate sets, which are sets of words that are similar across different languages. Traditional methods for reconstructing proto-languages have relied on full supervision, where a large amount of labeled data is available. However, in practice, it is often challenging to obtain such labeled data, resulting in an average accuracy of 87.3\% for state-of-the-art models.

\subsection{Motivation}
The scarcity of labeled data in historical reconstruction tasks has led to a significant decrease in the accuracy of models. Our approach aims to address this issue by leveraging unlabeled cognate sets to improve the performance of the model.

\section{Related Work}
Previous research on semisupervised historical reconstruction has focused on utilizing unlabeled data to enhance the performance of models trained on labeled data. However, these approaches have not considered the fundamental principle from linguists' comparative method, which is that reconstructed words should be deterministically transformable back into their daughter words.

Our approach, DPD-BiReconstructor, is motivated by this fundamental principle and is able to leverage unlabeled cognate sets to enhance its performance on this novel task.

\section{Methodology}
We propose a novel semisupervised historical reconstruction task, where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data (cognate sets with proto-forms) and a large amount of unlabeled data (cognate sets without proto-forms). Our neural architecture, DPD-BiReconstructor, incorporates the fundamental principle from linguists' comparative method and is able to leverage unlabeled cognate sets to enhance its performance.

The DPD-BiReconstructor algorithm is presented in Algorithm \ref{alg:dpd}, which outlines the steps for training and fine-tuning the model.

\section{Experiments}
We evaluate the performance of DPD-BiReconstructor on a novel task, where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. Our results are presented in Table \ref{tab:results}, which compares the performance of DPD-BiReconstructor with a strong semisupervised baseline.

\section{Conclusion}
We propose a novel semisupervised historical reconstruction task that combines the benefits of supervised and unsupervised learning. Our approach, DPD-BiReconstructor, outperforms strong semisupervised baselines on this novel task by an average margin of 18.2\%. We believe that this approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of historical reconstruction models and provide a new direction for research in this area.
