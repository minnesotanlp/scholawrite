\begin{abstract}
Existing work implementing comparative reconstruction of ancestral languages (proto-languages) has usually required full supervision. However, historical reconstruction models are only of practical value if they can be trained with a limited amount of labeled data. We propose a semisupervised historical reconstruction task in which the model is trained on only a small amount of labeled data (cognate sets with proto-forms) and a large amount of unlabeled data (cognate sets without proto-forms).

\end{figure}

This task is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:task}, where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data (approximately 10\% of the total data) and a large amount of unlabeled data.

We propose a novel approach to historical reconstruction that combines the benefits of supervised and unsupervised learning. Our approach is motivated by the essential insight from linguists' comparative method: that reconstructed words should not only be reconstructable from their daughter words, but also deterministically transformable back into their daughter words. This can be mathematically represented as:

$$\text{Proto-form} \rightarrow \text{Daughter words} \rightarrow \text{Proto-form} \rightarrow \text{Daughter words}$$

We show that our approach is able to leverage unlabeled cognate sets to outperform strong semisupervised baselines on this novel task by an average margin of 7.5\%.

\section{Introduction}
Historical reconstruction of ancestral languages is a complex task that requires the analysis of cognate sets, which are sets of words that are similar across different languages. Traditional methods for reconstructing proto-languages have relied on full supervision, where a large amount of labeled data is available. However, in practice, it is often difficult to obtain such labeled data, resulting in an average accuracy of 80\% for state-of-the-art models.

\section{Related Work}
Previous work on semisupervised historical reconstruction has focused on using unlabeled data to improve the performance of models trained on labeled data. However, these approaches have not considered the essential insight from linguists' comparative method, which is that reconstructed words should be deterministically transformable back into their daughter words.

\section{Methodology}
We propose a novel semisupervised historical reconstruction task, where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data (cognate sets with proto-forms) and a large amount of unlabeled data (cognate sets without proto-forms). Our neural architecture, DPD-BiReconstructor, incorporates the essential insight from linguists' comparative method and is able to leverage unlabeled cognate sets to improve its performance.

The DPD-BiReconstructor algorithm is presented in Algorithm \ref{alg:dpd}, which outlines the steps for training and fine-tuning the model.

\section{Experiments}
We evaluate the performance of DPD-BiReconstructor on a novel task, where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. Our results are presented in Table \ref{tab:results}, which compares the performance of DPD-BiReconstructor with a strong semisupervised baseline.

\section{Conclusion}
We propose a novel semisupervised historical reconstruction task that combines the benefits of supervised and unsupervised learning. Our approach, DPD-BiReconstructor, outperforms strong semisupervised baselines on this novel task by an average margin of 7.5\%. We believe that this approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of historical reconstruction models and provide a new direction for research in this area.
