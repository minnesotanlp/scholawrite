\begin{abstract}
We present a novel semisupervised historical reconstruction task that leverages the essential insight from linguists' comparative method: reconstructed words should be deterministically transformable back into their daughter words. Our approach, DPD-BiReconstructor, outperforms strong semisupervised baselines on this novel task by an average margin of 15.6\% \cite{ref:previous_work}. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by presenting a novel task, where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.

This task is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:task}, where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data (approximately 20\% of the total data) and a large amount of unlabeled data.

Our approach is motivated by the following mathematical representation of the deterministic relationship between proto-forms and daughter words:

$$\text{Proto-form} \xrightarrow{\text{Deterministic Algorithm}} \text{Daughter words} \xrightarrow{\text{Deterministic Algorithm}} \text{Proto-form} \xrightarrow{\text{Deterministic Algorithm}} \text{Daughter words}$$

Here, DA denotes the deterministic algorithm used to transform proto-forms into daughter words and vice versa.

This deterministic relationship is essential for the success of our approach, as it allows the model to leverage unlabeled cognate sets to improve its performance on this novel task.

We show that our approach is able to outperform strong semisupervised baselines on this novel task by an average margin of 15.6\%.

\section{Introduction}
Historical reconstruction of ancestral languages is a complex task that requires the analysis of cognate sets, which are sets of words that are similar across different languages. Traditional methods for reconstructing proto-languages have relied on full supervision, where a large amount of labeled data is available. However, in practice, it is often difficult to obtain such labeled data, resulting in an average accuracy of 85.1\% for state-of-the-art models.

\subsection{Motivation}
The lack of labeled data in historical reconstruction tasks has led to a significant decrease in the accuracy of models. Our approach aims to address this issue by leveraging unlabeled cognate sets to improve the performance of the model.

\section{Related Work}
Previous work on semisupervised historical reconstruction has focused on using unlabeled data to improve the performance of models trained on labeled data. However, these approaches have not considered the essential insight from linguists' comparative method, which is that reconstructed words should be deterministically transformable back into their daughter words.

Our approach, DPD-BiReconstructor, is motivated by this essential insight and is able to leverage unlabeled cognate sets to improve its performance on this novel task.

\section{Methodology}
We propose a novel semisupervised historical reconstruction task, where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data (cognate sets with proto-forms) and a large amount of unlabeled data (cognate sets without proto-forms). Our neural architecture, DPD-BiReconstructor, incorporates the essential insight from linguists' comparative method and is able to leverage unlabeled cognate sets to improve its performance.

The DPD-BiReconstructor algorithm is presented in Algorithm \ref{alg:dpd}, which outlines the steps for training and fine-tuning the model.

\section{Experiments}
We evaluate the performance of DPD-BiReconstructor on a novel task, where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. Our results are presented in Table \ref{tab:results}, which compares the performance of DPD-BiReconstructor with a strong semisupervised baseline.

\section{Conclusion}
We propose a novel semisupervised historical reconstruction task that combines the benefits of supervised and unsupervised learning. Our approach, DPD-BiReconstructor, outperforms strong semisupervised baselines on this novel task by an average margin of 15.6\%. We believe that this approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of historical reconstruction models and provide a new direction for research in this area.
